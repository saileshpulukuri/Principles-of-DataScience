1. 1) Frailty is physical weakness; lack of health or strength. Reduced grip strength in females
correlated with higher frailty scores and vice versa. Hand grip strength can be quantified by
measuring the amount of static force that the hand can squeeze around a dynamometer. The
force has most commonly been measured in kilograms and pounds. The table below represents
data from 10 female participants. The Height is measured in inches, Weight in pounds, Age in
years, Grip strength in kilograms. Frailty is qualitative attribute indicated the presence or
absence of the symptoms. (10 points)

Based on the following table, you must design AND implement a three‑stage workflow (ingest
→ process → analyze) with code and organized outputs. (reference study case in chapter
3). You need to save the raw data in csv file and read it into a pandas data frame and then
perform the following:
a. Unit standardization
i. Height_m = Height_in * 0.0254
ii. Weight_kg = Weight_lb * 0.45359237
b. Feature engineering
i. BMI = Weight_kg / (Height_m ** 2) (round to 2 decimals).
ii. AgeGroup (categorical): "<30", "30–45", "46–60", ">60" based on Age_yr.
c. Categorical → numeric encoding
i. Binary encoding: Frailty_binary (Y→1, N→0, store as int8).
ii. One‑hot encode AgeGroup into columns: AgeGroup_<30, AgeGroup_30–45,
AgeGroup_46–60, AgeGroup_>60
d. EDA & Reporting
I. Compute summary table: mean/median/std for numeric columns; save to
reports/findings.md .
II. Quantify relation of strength ↔ frailty: compute correlation between Grip_kg
and Frailty_binary, and report it.
