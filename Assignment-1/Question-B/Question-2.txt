Perform the 5 data visualization tasks (given below) on the student performance dataset given in the
link below. Each figure: 800×600 px, 300 DPI, title, labeled axes/units, legend if applicable, readable
ticks. For each, add a 5–8 sentence interpretation to reports. Before the visualizations
(analysis step) you need to perform ingestion stage and preprocessing step
(missing values etc.) (10 points).
A. V1 — Gender boxplots (math vs reading) (2 pts)
a. Question: Are there gender differences in math vs reading?
b. Chart: Side‑by‑side boxplots of math score and reading score grouped by gender.
B. V2 — Test prep impact on math (2 pts)
a. Question: Do students who completed test prep score higher in math?
b. Chart: Any chart of your choice for math score by test preparation course
(completed vs none).
C. V3 — Lunch type and average performance (2 pts)
a. Question: Does lunch type (standard vs free/reduced) relate to outcomes?
b. Chart: Grouped bar chart of mean overall_avg of all the scores (math, reading,
writing) by lunch.
D. V4 — Subject correlations (2 pts)
a. Question: How strongly do the three subjects move together?
b. Chart: Correlation heatmap for math, reading, writing with annotated coefficients.
E. V5 — Math vs reading with trend lines by test prep (2 pts)
a. Question: How strongly are math and reading scores associated, and do students who
completed the test‑preparation course have a different slope in the math–reading
relationship than those who did not?
b. Chart: Scatter plot with two straight best‑fit lines (one for each group: completed,
none).
i. X‑axis: reading score
ii. Y‑axis: math score
c. Color: Points colored by test preparation course (legend must show the two
groups and each group’s n).
