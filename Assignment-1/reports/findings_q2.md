# Findings — Question 2 (Visual Analytics)

_Dataset: StudentsPerformance (preprocessed for missing values; scores imputed with medians, categoricals with mode)._ 

## V1 — Gender Boxplots (Math vs Reading)
The boxplots for math and reading scores by gender show clear differences in performance patterns. Females have higher mean reading scores (≈72.6) compared to males (≈65.5), while males score slightly higher in math (≈68.7) compared to females (≈63.6). This indicates that on average, girls are stronger in reading while boys perform somewhat better in math. However, the boxplots also reveal overlapping interquartile ranges (IQRs), suggesting that the variability across genders is substantial and not all students follow the overall pattern. Outliers are present in both groups, indicating individual students who deviate strongly from the main trend. Overall, while some gender differences are evident, they are not absolute, and the distributions show a lot of common ground between male and female students.

## V2 — Test Preparation Course and Math
The comparison of math scores between students who completed test preparation and those who did not shows a clear difference. Students who completed the preparation course had a higher average math score (≈69.7) than those who did not (≈64.1). This supports the idea that structured test preparation positively impacts performance in mathematics. The boxplot also shows that while the central tendency is higher for the completed group, there is still overlap in the distributions. This overlap suggests that factors beyond test prep, such as prior knowledge, personal study habits, and motivation, also influence performance. Nevertheless, the consistent upward shift in the median indicates a tangible benefit from completing the preparation course.

## V3 — Lunch Type and Overall Average
The bar chart of mean overall averages by lunch type highlights a socioeconomic dimension of student performance. Students receiving a standard lunch scored higher on average (≈70.8) than those receiving free/reduced lunch (≈62.2). This gap suggests that students with greater access to resources, as proxied by lunch type, tend to perform better academically. The difference of nearly 9 points across the averages is substantial and cannot be ignored. It may reflect broader issues such as home environment, nutrition quality, or access to tutoring and study resources. However, while the average is lower for the free/reduced group, individual students in that group still achieve strong results, showing that socioeconomic status does not fully determine outcomes.

## V4 — Subject Correlations
The correlation heatmap shows strong positive relationships among math, reading, and writing scores. Reading and writing have the strongest correlation (≈0.95), suggesting that skills in one language-based subject are highly predictive of performance in the other. Math is also positively correlated with both reading (≈0.82) and writing (≈0.80), though the relationships are slightly weaker. This pattern indicates that students who perform well in one subject are generally likely to perform well in others. The strength of these correlations points to shared underlying factors such as study habits, overall academic ability, or external support. It also suggests that interventions targeting literacy may indirectly benefit math, and vice versa, because the skills reinforce each other.

## V5 — Math vs Reading with Trend Lines by Test Prep
The scatterplot with fitted regression lines shows a strong positive association between reading and math scores. For both groups (completed vs none), students with higher reading scores also tend to have higher math scores. The slope of the regression line is ≈0.84 for the completed group and ≈0.86 for the non-completed group, indicating similar trends. However, the completed group tends to have higher overall scores, showing an upward shift in performance even if the rate of increase is similar. The distributions also confirm that test prep does not just affect math in isolation but is associated with broader performance. This visualization reinforces the idea that strong reading skills and preparation both contribute positively to math achievement.
